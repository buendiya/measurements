This set of Python scripts represent my first attempt at real-time data acquisition and plotting 
with PyVISA and pylibnidaqmx. 

The goal was to keep the plotting as simple as possible to facilitate easy writing of new experiment classes. 
These measurements do work, but they aren't nearly as reliable as I'd like and adding additional feedback for
the user quickly becomes very complicated. 

The heirarchy of these experiment functions is as follows...

instruments.py -- Creates a class for each GPIB/RS232 device in our lab as a subclass of some PyVISA instrument
specific instrument/measurement classes (e.g. nanovoltmeter.py) -- These create subclasses out of the instrument
    classes in instruments.py. The idea was to create a class for a specific type of measurement using that
    particular instrument (IV curve, differential conductance, ...). 
measurement classes (e.g. keithleypair_IV_swpVar.py) -- These classes/functions build specific experiments around
    the measurement classes defined for each instrument. 

For example....

If I want to take several IV curves, each at a different magnetic field, using the Keithley 6220 and 2182A, I 
can use keithleypair_IV_swpVar.IV_MagField(). This function uses instruemnts.oxford_magnet to control the field
and keithleypair.IVmax1024 (which is a subclass of instruments.K6220_2182A)
